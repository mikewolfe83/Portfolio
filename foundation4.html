                    <p>On my journey in the corporate world, I have thought about</p><p> if I could go back and talk to 18 year old Mike what information could I give him to make the path efficient to success.
                    </p> 
                    <p>So through my years of growing and learning, mistakes and bloopers, I came up with an acronym.</p> <p>I created SECM which stands for Skillset, Education, Communication, Mindset. These 4 things are a constant maintenance and growth with time and experience and I think if a young person would take advantage of this information they can increase the chance of success efficiently and early in life.</p>

               <p>I would recommend that a person learn from everything that you do or have access to. Sometimes it's all about connecting the dots and understanding how things work.</p> 
                
                <p>That is a way to figure out what you are good at and also a way to find out the next idea that could make you a successful entrepreneur and fill a demand that could change the game.
